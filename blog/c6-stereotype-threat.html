        Sterotype Threat, Not All In Your Head
        <br>
        <h2>2015 August 16</h2>
          <section>
            <p>
              I'd like to start with a idea I had while doing some background reading: does sterotype threat exist when the competence being tested is <em>succeptability to stereotypes</em>? That is, consider an individual who belongs to Group X, about whom the following sterotype exists: "Group X is particularly prone to holding beliefs and preferences based on stereotypes." Could such knowledge actually <em>hinder</em> this group's ability recognize and reject steotypes in their thought patterns?
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              In day-to-day interactions, probably not. The implicit danger in sterotypes is that they provide shortcuts to reasoned judgement, acting through <a href="http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/shleifer/files/kahneman_review_jel_final.pdf">what Daniel Kanheman describes as "System 1"</a> in his book <em>Thinking Fast and Slow</em>. The fast mode of the title, System 1 is "intuitive, automatic, unconscious, and effortless," but also "nonstatistical, gullible, and heuristic." System 2, by contrast, is "conscious, slow, controlled, deliberate, effortful, statistical, suspicious, and lazy (costly to use)." System 1 controls the majority of our actions to the extent that we don't even realize we're using it, while System 2 only takes over when we consciously activate it, by recognizing a problem that requires measured thought. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              Instilling in an individual an anxiety about their own vulnerability to the influence stereotypes, in other words, is unlikely to self-fulfill. (This is a good thing -- if the only way to avoid stereotypes was to pretend they didn't exist, we'd be in quite a bit of trouble.) The anxiety arriving with this awareness will make them slow down, pay more attention to their decisions, and ultimately reduce the influence of System 1 in relevant scenario... at least, where they have the luxury of time to make measured decisions. In an experimental environment like Project Implicit, where participants are given high-time-pressure tests and instructed to react to images of other humans stratified across demographics like gender, race, and age, System 1 can run rampant. Consider that in the <a href="https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/selectatest.html">directory of tests</a>, one test includes the label, "This test often indicates that Americans have automatic preference for young over old." I wonder if exposure to this sort of caveat would actually impact the performance of the group in question.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              Anyway, this sort of meta-problem is certainly of less social importance than the original matter of Steele's piece, both in the specific case (how the stereotypes surrounding academia and intellgience negatively impact the performance of black students) and in the general (how stereotypes at large can lead to materially worse outcomes for affected groups). But asking those meta-questions did lead me to consider Kahneman's framework, the usefulness of which is readily apparent in addressing the more crucial matters.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              Consider what was the most interesting piece, for me, of <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/08/thin-ice-stereotype-threat-and-black-college-students/304663/">Steele's original article</a>: the apparent ease with which he and his his colleagues neutralized stereotype threat in their experiments.
              <br>
              <br>
              <blockquote><em>
                We needed some way to determine if it was indeed stereotype threat that depressed the black students' scores. [...] We stressed that the task did not measure a person's level of intellectual ability. A simple instruction, yes, but it profoundly changed the meaning of the situation. In one stroke "spotlight anxiety," as the psychologist William Cross once called it, was turned offâ€”and the black students' performance on the test rose to match that of equally qualified whites.
              </em></blockquote>
              <br>

              System 2 is supposed to be the "decision maker," the one that performs better at careful deliberation and self-examination. But System 2 is also a resource hog. In programmer terms, it's computationally intensive. Working on some sort of standardized test, such as the material Steele's test subjects were presented, is already sufficient to invoke System 2. The anxiety of the being under the stereotyped spotlight, however, isn't a carefully reasoned response. It's a unconscious, emotional reaction, the domain of Kahneman's System 1. Much study has been done on exactly what mechanism allows stereotype threat to manifest, and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2570773/">one widely-cited explanation</a> suggests that the brain is coerced into spending resources on performance monitoring and anxiety-suppression, resources that might otherwise go into problem-solving.
