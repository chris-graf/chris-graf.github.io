        It Is Very Late Right Now: A Placeholder Title about Feedback
        <br>
        <h2>2015 August 09</h2>

              Ramble: <em>engage</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              The peer pairing thing has been the biggest cultural adjustment so far in my short-but-satisfying DBC career. I am <em>all about</em> increasing interpersonal openness and honesty, though, so the feedback system itself seemed right up my alley. I really do love getting reviewed and evaluated in general because I have a powerful interest in expanding my own perspective. If we could all step outside our bodies and see ourselves the way others do, no more wars, end of world hunger, the whales, yadda yadda. It'd be nice, is what I'm saying.
            </p>
            <p>
              That's not to say I always react well to feeback. Before I discovered coding, my main hobby was noodling around at The Second City and the Chicago improv scene. (Side note: If you haven't seen Improv Shakespeare, and you are currently in the City of Chicago, and it is between 7 and 9 PM on a Thursday or Friday night, and it's not life-imperilingly cold outside, and you're not holding anything breakable or alive, DROP whatever you're doing and go see them. I'll wait.)
            </p>
            <p>
              So the hobby, it involved taking classes at The Second City's training center. The first of these classes I took was sketch writing. Writing is a very collaborative process, and I'd wager to say comedy proves this need for collaboration better than any other form. There were plenty of times over the months that I'd receive some feedback from a teacher or another student, accept it, learn from it, incorporate it, and improve the final product. There were also a <em>couple</em> times I'd get a note and think, "Wow, this person totally missed the point." I'd get defensive: "I've spent hours writing and rewriting this piece, the context couldn't be any more clear," or "I've seen this person's other work, they have no right to judge my material." We think we're open-minded, but every now and then a nerve trips and your ego comes roaring into things. But the thing you come to realize, at the end of the day, is that just because something makes perfect sense in your head doesn't mean it's not going to turn into garbage salad as soon as you put it on paper. It's one of the great tragedies of human existence that we have all these fantastic ideas and sublime opinions, but we're stuck communicating them with the language built for our flappy little monkey mouths. Your audience is who you're making all this stuff for, which makes them the final judge of your product. In pairing session, that product is the communication itself, and that audience is the person sitting next to you. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I haven't received a ton of actionable advice to this point. Most of my feedback has been very kind, but boils down to "Had fun, keep doing what you're doing." This is fine, of course, and if I could keep doing what I'm doing for the rest of my life and never run into an obstacle, I'd be the luckiest flappy monkey who ever lived. But eventually we're all going to run into a person we just don't mesh well with, and the sooner you can discover how to deal with those situations, the better. And if it's in a controlled, low-stakes environment like a bit of pairing-inspired feedback, better than better.
            </p>
            <p>
              So of the feedback I've gotten so far, the best tip is to be more specific when I'm discussing things. I could decide I'm doing things just fine, and solider on in the belief that my partner should have the initiative to let me know when they're confused, but it seems better in the long run to take as much ownership as possible of my communications, and leave less room for the variance of my partner's own style to throw off our dynamic. We'll see how it works out, I have a feeling things will be cast in HD once we get on site.
