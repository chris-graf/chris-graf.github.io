        Sorry, Barry Gordon: The Slow Death of Flash
        <br>
        <h2>2015 August 02</h2>
          <section>
            <p>
              Google, Facebook, and Mozilla all made headlines recently with their campaigns against a common foe: Adobe Flash, the multimedia content platform. Most famously used in conjunction with the Flash Player plugin for playing videos and other media in web browsers, Adobe Flash has long endured criticism from the tech community for its closed-source ownership, technical limitations, and numerous security flaws.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the last month or so, several tech giants have signaled their interest in the death of this 19 year-old platform (which is approximately 250 in Internet years). Google announced that its Chrome web browser will soon be updated to disable superfluous Flash media (such as video ads). Facebook's Chief Securtiy Officer, speaking through Twitter, proded Abode to announce a phase-out date for the platform. And in the most drastic move, Mozilla blocked Flash Player entirely in a recent update to its Firefox browser. While this block isn't a permanent one (Mozilla has promised renable Flash support once its most recent suite of security vulernabilities have been fixed), it sends a strong signal to Adobe and the tech community at large that opposition to the widely-used, almost-as-widely-criticized platform is mounting.
            <p>
              The most common criticism of Flash hinges on its proprietary nature: a closed-source tool has no place on an open-source Internet. Steve Jobs published <a href="https://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/">a widely-circulated takedown of Flash</a> in 2010 by way of explaining why Apple did not support the media player on its mobile devices. First among Jobs' his reasons was the fact that Flash and its associated products are "100% proprietary," making it an ultimately unreliable solution for any firm that wants to control its means of content delivery. The Worldwide Web is built on open standards, and an any widely-integrated yet privately-controlled content delivery bottleneck threatens this openness.
            </p>
            <p>
              Desipite the growing support for the Occupy Flash movement, Adobe naturally doesn't see much upside in sacrificing the significant share of web media the platform still retains, so the web may have to abandon Flash of its own accord. The transition away from Flash won't be a simple one. Most video ads on the internet are built on Flash, meaning a substantial portion of revenue for web companies is predicated, at least in the short term, on Flash's continued survival. Lukcily, numerous alternatives to Flash already exist: HTML5, JavaScript, and the H.264 video codec are all open-source solutions to interactive web media that have increased in popularity as Flash's star has waned. We can't predict how many more major hacks it will take, or how many hundreds of daily updates will pass before the Flash player goes the way of Betamax and AOL, but eventually that day will arrive.
