              Release 1: Exploring Your Value
              <br>
              <em>"When you think of the times in your life where youâ€™ve been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, which of the following values come to mind?"</em>
              <br>
              Answers:
              <ul>
                <li>Accomplishment</li>
                <li>Achievement</li>
                <li>Affection</li>
                <li>Challenge</li>
                <li>Close relationships</li>
                <li>Confidence</li>
                <li>Enthusiasm</li>
                <li>Excellence</li>
                <li>Friendships</li>
                <li>Independence</li>
                <li>Intellectual status</li>
                <li>Recognition</li>
                <li>Self-knowledge</li>
                <li>Serenity</li>
                <li>Synonyms</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              Release 2: Values in your Life
              <br>
              <em>"In general, I try to live up to these values:""</em>
              <br>
              Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- <strong>(5)</strong> Agree
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              Release 3: Select a value
              <br>
              <em>"Pick one value and write a couple of sentences about why the value you chose is important to you."</em>
              <br>
              <strong>Enthusiasm:</strong> Passion, but more family-friendly? To live enthusiastically, it's not enough to simply <em>have</em> passions, you must also openly embrace them. Enthusiasm is a celebratory virtue, one that brings happiness to both yourself, and to others who share it with you. Dicussing common passions is one of the primary ways I connect with other people. Enthusiasm is one of the easiest values to achieve within ourselves, but it can also lead to many others on the list in how it enables us to invoke and focus our energy toward a goal.

              Release 4: Advice
              <br>
              <em>"What was the last topic that someone asked for your advice on? Did it relate to any of the values you found important?"</em>
              <br>
              Depending on how you define "advice," that last topic was either querying with PostgreSQL, or where to find the best Chinese food delivery. I certainly have enthusiasm for both these topics, though the former does more to feed the Accomplishment, Challenge, Intellectual status, and similar values, while the latter is more abotu Friendships and Serenity.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              Release 5: Values and Stereotype threat
              <br>
              <em>"How do you feel when you think about your values? Do you think it can help you mediate stereotype threat if you recognize you feel it?"</em>
              <br>
              I'm pretty satisfied with my list of values. Convenient, since the list includes Self-knowledge and Serenity. I'm willing to admit some inclusions and omissions both: I do care more about Intellectual status and Recognition than I would like, and in the same way less about Environmentalism and Volunteering.
              <br>
              I'm sure I've experienced Stereotype bias at some point in my life (I do have tools to combat selection bias), but it's difficult to bring any instances to mind. The reality, sad or otherwise, is that there aren't very many negative, ability-focused stereotypes surrounding what is the quintessential privileged majority group: white, heterosexual, cis-, able-bodied, college-educated men, for whom the greatest stereotype is the absence of stereotypes. That, and we can't dance. Come to think of it, that second one might hit closer to home than I expected: I'll try to keep up my affirmation the next time I go clubbing.
            </p>
            <p>
            (As a side note, following up on last week's post, it's still pretty fascinating that affirmation can actually decrease the rate of sterotyping itself, according to Martens et al. (2006), as cited in <a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/reduce.html#encouragingself">the article linked with this challenge</a>.)
