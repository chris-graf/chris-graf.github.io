        No Method to the Madness: JavaScript Functions for the Inquiring Rubyist
        <br>

              JavaScript's take on the object-oriented paradigm may not seem as clean or elegant as Ruby's at first look, but in some ways, JavaScript is a more object-y language than Ruby.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              First, let's take a look at how you might, as a Rubyist would say, construct a class in the two different languages. In Ruby:
              <br>
              <code>
              <br>
                class CoolClass

                  def initialize(some_number)
                <pre>    </pre>@fun_level = some_number
                <pre>  </pre>end

                  def pump_it_up
                    @fun_level += 1
                  end

                end

                my_cool_class = CoolClass.new(99)
                my_cool_class.fun_level
                => 99
                my_cool_class.pump_it_up
                my_cool_class.fun_level
                => 100

              </code>
              And in JavaScript:
              <br>
              <code><pre>
              <br>
                var CoolClass = function(someNumber) {
                  this.funLevel = someNumber;
                  this.pumpItUp = function() {
                    this.funLevel++;
                  }
                }

               var myCoolClass = new CoolClass(99);
               myCoolClass.funLevel;
               // 99
               myCoolClass.pumpItUp();
               myCoolClass.funLevel;
               // 100
              </pre></code>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              (These examples don't necessarily represent the idealized form of either language - the Ruby example would almost certainly include at least an <code>attr_reader</code> to wrap the <code>@fun_level</code> instance variable, for examle - but for the purpose of demonstrating equivalence or lack thereof, they'll do.)
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              The main difference, perhaps, is how <em>clumpy</em> the JavaScript implementation is compared to the Ruby one. In Ruby's CoolClass, we've got the <code>intialize</code> method separated from <code>pump_it_up</code>. Each method contains some expression involving variables, and the methods in turn are contained by the class. There's a clear delineation between the methods, and the objects they operate upon. In JavaScript, we don't have this obvious separation of method and object. Instead, our "class" is a function being assigned to a variable (this would be less obvious if we defined this function with a declaration instead of an expression, but in this context the result is the same). This function constructs an object with two properties, one of which is another function. And in JavaScript, it turns out, functions, properties, and variables are all just various grades of object. At the fundamental level, our JavaScript class is simply creating and connecting objects to one another, with no major distinctions.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              It is this total reliance on objects that allows one to argue that JavaScript is more purely object-oriented than Ruby. That's not a value judgement, and there are counterarguments aplenty (nevermind exceptions to every rule we mentioned above), but these example nonetheless illustrate one of the fundamental differences in how these two languages approach the OO paradigm.
