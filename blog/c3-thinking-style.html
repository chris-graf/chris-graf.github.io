        Fixed vs. Growth Mindsets, and Why the Rest is Fluff
        <br>

              I tried out that Personal Thinking Styles test. Turns out, I'm an "Abstract Sequentialist." Wow! I didn't read the entire description, but I'm pretty sure that's the type that believes all of these limited binary, psuedo-psychological profiling schemes are a bunch of hot nonsense.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have a BA in Sociology. I have a great respect for the social sciences, of aspects both qualitative and quantitative. I <em>do not</em> have respect for The Mind Styles of Dr. Gregorc, for Myers-Briggs Type Indicators, for VARK, or for any other unsubstantiated methodology that claims to fit people into neat little boxes based on answers to self-administered 20-question multiple choice survery. Ahem.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's not surprising that these systems are so attractive. Humans love groups. We like being told we're special, and that we belong with other special people. These systems meet that need with an sheen of scientific authority. Myers-Briggs is a particularly tempting trap these days, with its celebration of intro- and extro-version across sixteen fancifully-acronymed tribes. It just <em>feels</em> right. Of course I'm an ESFP, because I'm a go-getter, I love conversation, helping my friends, and long walks on the beach. It's astrology, repackaged for Psych 101.
            </p>
            <p>
              Decoding a personality into discrete terms is no easy task, but it's not an impossible one: Amazon, Spotify, Netflix, and other content-delivery platforms have created effective models to predict things like musical taste and shopping habits, but continue to spend millions of dollars and thousands of man hours every year to build and improve upon them. And these are evidence-based, results-driven models with strong indicators of both internal and external validity. The peer reviewes of the various psychological profiling techniques <a href="http://psi.sagepub.com/content/9/3/105.full">are not always as favorable.</a> 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              This is a <em>real question</em> on the VARK questionnaire:
            <blockquote>
              <strong>I like websites that have:</strong>
              <ul>
              <li>things I can click on, shift or try.</li>
              <li>interesting written descriptions, lists and explanations.</li>
              <li>audio channels where I can hear music, radio programs or interviews.</li>
              <li>interesting design and visual features.</li>
              </ul>
            </blockquote>
            </p>
            <p>
              For yea, it is well known that there are only four kinds of people in this world, and the kind that enjoy "written descriptions" cannot tolerate "things [they] can click on," and that to the discrete minority group of internet users that do enjoy clicking on things, "visual features" and "radio programs" are as abhorrent as a rattling viper.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              But I didn't come here <em>just</em> to rant, and negativity can get old pretty fast. If Gregorc is nonsense, Dweck is anything but. The Fixed/Growth Mindset binary differs from the above systems in very important ways. Most critically, there is <a href="http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/eli-finkel/documents/InPress_BurnetteOBoyleVanEppsPollackFinkel_PsychBull.pdf">an actual body of evidence</a> that suggests self-assessed capability does impact educational outcomes. That's enough to make the work valuable and worth further study. But from the skeptical consumer's perspective, it certainly bolsters confidence that Dweck takes a much more honest approach to her thesis than the magical thinkers of MBTI and co.
            </p>
            <p>
              There's an actual <em>lesson</em> behind Dweck's work. I can't tell you what the hell I'm supposed to do with the idea that I'm an Abstract Sequentialist any more than I can tell you what it means that Venus is in the Third House. (Gregorc suggests certain learning environments for all his types, but suffers from the implication that, say, having the opportunity to work both alone and with a group as needed isn't useful for everyone.) Yet if I've been living in a fixed mindset all my life, Dweck's message is both novel and useful: stop it. The fluffy typing schemes shy aware from the idea that any type is better than any other--we're all unique, after all, just like everyone else--but Dweck makes crystal clear that hers is no binary of equals. A growth mindset is straight-up superior to a fixed one.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now <em>that</em> is useful feedback.
