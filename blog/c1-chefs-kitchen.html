        Your Table is Not Ready

        <h2>2015 July 12</h2>

              Early in his fireside chat, Shereef Bishay implores us, as DBC students, to try to avoid entering the program with a 'restaurant mindset,' wherein we see ourselves as consumers, and DBC as a provider whom we expect to provide us with packaged, digestible service. We should cast away that attitude, he tells us, and move toward taking ownership of our own education.
            </p>
            <p>
             	The cynic in me hears the founder of this company saying, "Hey guys, I know you just paid 12 thousand dollars and quit your job to join this program, but don't think you're <em>entitled</em> to anything." But while this skepticism is understandable, even relatable, it doesn't do anyone any good. That minimalization of entitlement is itself a critical component of the "product" that is a DBC education. We're students, not consumers.	The consumer is passive. The consumer gets to sit down and experience the service without participating. The student, though, is defined by their participation. After all, if we want to be the ones eventually <em>providing</em> the service, we need act like it. This is a decision we all have to make, and one we'll need to reaffirm every day.
            </p>
            <p>
              Certainly there are things we can expect from DBC. We can expect them to provide us with the tools and resources, but we can't expect them to straighten our backs and move our limbs. It doesn't matter how much money we pay, or how many jobs we quit: we can't learn without activtly participating ourselves, and neither DBC nor anyone else can teach us anything meaningful, worthwhile, and permanent if we don't meet them halfway.
